Castloader D "What mesh is the titanium you found? " The bag says "Titanium flake -40 +150 M", can I assume "M" should have been "Um"? It is very fine, about midway between table sugar grains and flour particles. I thought I'd do a test using two mixtures, one of a BP measure mixed with a small measure of aluminum powder which I also bought, and another with the same measures of BP and Ti, and burn them in a darkened shop with a camera, sending the clips here.
